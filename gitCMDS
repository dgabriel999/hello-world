Github stuff

First set up remote with git remote to set up connection with local computer with public online project/server
git remote add (nickname for repo) https://github.com/dgabriel999/hello-world.git

to push onto the website -- {git push -u (name of your repo) master}
fetch grabs it

.gitignore - ignore the files or folders you dont want to keep track of, like settings files, etc

checkout githubDesktop , probably wont download it becasue I am using virtual machine and my mac for seperate projects
publish takes chagnes we make locally and puts them on the websites
